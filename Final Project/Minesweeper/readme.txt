This game can be located anywhere on a computer to run.

If VS warns some package is missing, in the package manager, type

Install-Package "System.ValueTuple"

and hit enter. 

Then hit build to build the application


VS may lock the whole folder and block disk IO while running the project.
If that's the case, simply close VS and run the application directly from the exe file uner bin/Debug/

Drag-release difficulty selector I mentioned in phase 2 was not implemented, because the difficulty exceeds my estimation.
